This repository contains the study of the Crab Nebula (Tau A) using four QUIJOTE wide survey maps at 11, 13, 17, and 19 GHz. The maps (5° × 5°, 200 × 200 pixels, pixel size 1.5 arcmin) are centered at Galactic coordinates l = 184.6°, b = −5.78°, with brightness temperature units in mK. Aperture photometry is applied to compute flux densities, subtracting the background measured in annular rings (θ₁ = FWHM, θ₂ = FWHM·√2), and integrating within circular apertures (θ_ap = FWHM). The fraction of flux outside the aperture is estimated assuming Tau A is point-like and the QUIJOTE beam is Gaussian. The spectral index α is derived from multi-frequency fluxes (S_ν ∝ ν^α).
